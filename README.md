# 👋 Hola! I'm Meet Suthar

🌍 Hailing from the vibrant and joyful city of Ahmedabad, India, I'm on a mission to gain great skills in development while pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at Ahmedabad University (2022-2026).

💻 I'm passionate about blending creativity with code. If you find me not coding, I'm probably brainstorming ways to make the website a more beautiful!

## 💼 Side Hustle

🎨 When I'm not battling bugs, I'm wearing my design hat! I dabble in graphic design as a freelancer, with a special love for creating sports jerseys and kits. Curious? Check out my work on Instagram at [sevenite.graphics](https://instagram.com/sevenite.graphics)! 

🏏 **Fun Fact:** I've designed more jerseys than I've worn! And yes, my dream is to design a jersey that makes it to the Cricket World Cup one day!

## 🎬 Hobbies & Interests

- **Movies**: I'm a certified thriller aficionado! Favorites include *Interstellar* (because space is cool) and *Se7en* (because of that last scene, duh!). 🍿
- **Reddit**: I lose track of time exploring the depths of Reddit (Unfortunatly 😛). If there's a subreddit for it, I've probably lurked there! 🕵️‍♂️
- **Vexillology**: Flags are more interesting than you think. Trust me, I can talk about them for hours. 🇮🇳

## 🎯 Fun Facts & Quirks

- **Vexillology Vibes**: Yes, I have strong opinions about flag designs. Let's chat over a cup of coffee about why Bhutan's flag is awesome!
